			<ul class="causestext">
				<li class="causestext">All tribal settlements in India are located in some of the most remote regions of the country. Most of the villages do not have access to basic amenities.</li>
				<li class="causestext">Inadequate healthcare infrastructure results in deaths owing to preventable diseases like Malaria, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice, and tuberculosis. Malnutrition and occurrences of sickle-cell anaemia are especially pervasive amongst the tribals of Bastar.</li>
				<li class="causestext">Nutritional deficiency leads to diseases like endemic goiter, anemia, pellagra and beriberi.</li>
				<li class="causestext">Lack of personal hygiene, poor sanitation, inadequate mother-child health services, absence of health education, and lack of national preventive programs result in overall poor health of tribal people in Bastar.</li>
				<li class="causestext">Maternal and infant mortality rate tends to be high due to unhygienic conditions and lackadaisical attitude of the tribals in seeking appropriate health care. Since medical facilities are extremely uncommon in these regions, they are faced with the hard choice of traveling 20-30 kms to seek treatment or ensuring their families are taken care of.</li>
				<li class="causestext">In the absence of basic medical facilities, the locals rely on traditional medicine or inappropriate tribal practices to rid them of illnesses at times which make it excessively difcult for health workers to convince them to seek medical help in cases of emergencies.</li>
				<li class="causestext">Lack of proper diagnostic devices during camps results in incomplete or inaccurate diagnosis of patients resulting in incomplete and inefcient healthcare services.</li>
				<li class="causestext">It is imperative that all interventions focus on tribal culture and cater to a health care system that focuses on community needs.</li>

				<p>• Bastar receives heavy rainfall and a lot of tribal settlements are cut off during these months.The number of people attending the medical camp also reduces drastically. Therefore, after numerous discussions with our local support personnel and organizations we have decided to conduct 2 camps per month during 4 monsoon months (June-September) and 4 camps per month during rest of the year (October-May). </p> 

				<p><b>• We are currently raising funds to provide for medical camps through out 2018-19. INR. 4,78,760 per month (October to May) and INR. 2,39,380 per month during the rainy season(June-September) -- an estimated INR. 47,87,600 /- per year.</b></p>
