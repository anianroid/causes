                <h4>Documentary Funds</h4>
                <p>‘Rest Of My Family’ is a social-work-through-art initiative. Through the very design of our project, we aim to propagate a philosophy and a responsible way of looking at social issues through works of art. The aim is to use conventional and experimental modes of expression/art-forms- mix-media, multimedia art forms, documentary films, photo stories in order to bring about an engaging and long lasting social movement and transformation. With our efforts we wish to start a social movement towards a way of thinking that can bring about a long lasting transformation in the world. To achieve such a wide- spread and deep social penetration we need to use all creative mediums of expression in an efficient manner. By doing so we can ensure that we are making the most out of our work on ground.</p>
